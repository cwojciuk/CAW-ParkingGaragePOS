The ParkingGaragePOS system that I implemented attempts to keep dependencies down to the bare minimum. It takes what a clerk behind the computer would do and makes a calculation based upon how long a visit is.

Note: I partially implemented methods that would allow an accurate time stamp to given to a method removing multiple dependencies from multiple classes. Would have made a new class TimeStamp.
